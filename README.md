# PDF-Translator-AI 🇮🇳  
**AI-powered PDF translation platform for Indian regional languages**

A production-ready system for translating PDF documents into **Indian languages** such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi, and more. Designed for scale, accuracy, and real-world document complexity common in Indian workflows.

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

India produces massive volumes of PDFs in:
- Government notifications
- Legal and compliance documents
- Educational content
- Financial & banking reports
- Healthcare and public sector communication

Most translation tools:
- Fail on mixed-language PDFs (English + Indic)
- Break document structure
- Do not support Indian scripts reliably
- Are not API-first or scalable

**PDF-Translator-AI** addresses these gaps with an AI-driven, Indian-language–focused translation pipeline.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

PDF-Translator-AI combines:
- Layout-aware PDF text extraction
- AI-powered Indic language translation
- Chunk-based processing for large documents
- Clean REST APIs for integration with existing systems

Built to support **government, enterprise, ed-tech, and legal use cases** across India.
